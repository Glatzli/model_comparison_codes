	abstract = {Diurnal mountain wind systems are local thermally driven wind systems that form over mountainous terrain and are produced by the buoyancy effects associated with the diurnal cycle of heating and cooling of the lower atmospheric layers. This chapter reviews the present scientific understanding of diurnal mountain wind systems, focusing on research findings published since 1988. Slope flows are examined first, as they provide a good introduction to the many factors affecting diurnal mountain wind systems. The energy budgets governing slope flows; the effects of turbulence, slope angle, ambient stability, background flows and slope inhomogeneities on slope flows; and the methods used to simulate slope flows are examined. Then, valley winds are reviewed in a similar manner and the diurnal phases of valley and slope winds and their interactions are summarized. Recent research on large-scale mountain-plain wind systems is reviewed, with an emphasis on the Rocky Mountains and the Alps. Winds occurring in closed basins and over plateaus are then discussed, and analogies between the two wind systems are outlined. This is followed by a discussion of forecasting considerations for diurnal mountain wind systems. Finally, the chapter concludes with a summary of open questions and productive areas for further research.},

	title = {{TEAMx} cold-air pool model intercomparison study},
	url = {https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EMS2024/EMS2024-504.html},
	abstract = {Cold-air pools pose a significant challenge for numerical weather prediction models, primarily because they are often characterized by very stable stratification. Traditional surface-layer parameterizations, which rely on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, tend to be ineffective in these conditions. Additionally, the processes involved are highly localized and occur on small spatial scales, necessitating models with high horizontal and vertical resolutions. Within the TEAMx research programme, a model intercomparison study is being undertaken. The goal is to assess how well various numerical weather prediction models, each with a horizontal grid spacing of 1 km, can simulate a nocturnal cold-air pool within an Alpine valley. Five models are currently participating in the intercomparison study, including both operational and research models, specifically AROME, ICON, Meso-NH, the Unified Model, and WRF. For the intercomparison, a case study was selected from a multi-day undisturbed period during the PIANO (Penetration and Interruption of Alpine Foehn) field campaign conducted in the Inn Valley, Austria, in fall 2017.The presentation will show first results from the model intercomparison study. An extensive dataset is available for model evaluation from the PIANO measurement campaign, including vertical profiles of wind, temperature, and humidity from multiple Doppler wind lidars and a microwave temperature and humidity profiler, surface observations including surface-energy fluxes from multiple automatic weather stations and eddy-covariance stations, and spatially distributed temperature measurements from a dense network of temperature sensors. The model evaluation and intercomparison covers the entire lifecycle of the cold-air pool, from its initial formation in the afternoon to its dissipation the following day. The analysis addresses specifically the question of how well the simulations represent the cold-air pool's characteristics, such as its intensity, vertical structure, and spatial heterogeneity, and the processes contributing to the temporal evolution and spatial structure of the cold-air pool.},

	abstract = {The formation of stably stratified nocturnal Cold Air Pools (CAPs) is a frequently observed phenomenon in mountain valleys and sinkholes. Accurate representation of CAPs in numerical weather prediction models is important because they de termine local temperatures, may deteriorate air quality, and promote high-impact weather such as freezing rain. The CAP episode from 15-16 October, 2017, in the Inn Valley (Austria) has been selected for an evaluation of simulations conducted with the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model 1 km horizontal grid resolution. As this case was part of the Penetration and Interruption of Alpine Foehn (PIANO) field campaign, high abundance of observational data allows for a thorough analy sis of the horizontal and vertical structure of the CAP, as well as of the processes driving the CAP life cycle. The observational data reveals that this CAP episode featured a near-surface air temperature decrease of 17 K during formation and ma ture phase. The vertical expansion of the CAP is limited by a topping inversion at about 1000 m above ground level. ICON exhibits a significant warm bias below the top of the inversion, but manages to simulate the timing of the CAP life cycle well. The emission of longwave radiation from the Earth’s surface towards the atmo sphere proved to be the main mechanism for the simulated cooling, while turbulent heating was responsible for the dissipation of the simulated CAP. The discrepancies between the simulations and observations are mainly related to the representation of radiation and turbulence in the model as well as to the insufficient representation of the complex topography due to a too coarse horizontal resolution of the model.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          This study introduces a novel evaluation technique for mesoscale atmospheric models in complex terrain, addressing challenges related to grid point (GP) selection, model resolution, and differences in the terrain and measurement heights between model and observation sites. The technique includes a pre-evaluation step designed to enhance model evaluation accuracy by correcting for systematic biases arising from discrepancies in sensor height between surface-layer diagnosed variables and actual measurement heights. Additionally, a lapse rate correction is proposed that takes into account the temporal evolution of the valley atmosphere. We use a GP for the evaluation with point measurements that represents the topographic characteristics at the measurement site better than the nearest GP. 
The analysis of a case study using a WRF simulation with different grid spacing is conducted for a synoptically undisturbed valley wind day over the Inn Valley, to study the effect of grid resolution during an entire diurnal cycle.
The proposed method shows significant potential in reducing uncertainties in model performance assessments by selecting GPs that better represent in-situ conditions, including accurate land cover and orography characteristics. This approach is expected to facilitate more reliable inter-model comparisons and enhance the overall robustness of atmospheric model evaluations in complex terrains.},
