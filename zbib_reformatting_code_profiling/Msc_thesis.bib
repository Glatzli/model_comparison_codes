	abstract = {This review paper explores the field of mesoscale to microscale modeling over complex terrain as it traverses multiple so-called gray zones. In an attempt to bridge the gap between previous large-scale and small-scale modeling efforts, atmospheric simulations are being run at an unprecedented range of resolutions. The gray zone is the range of grid resolutions where particular features are neither subgrid nor fully resolved, but rather are partially resolved. The definition of a gray zone depends strongly on the feature being represented and its relationship to the model resolution. This paper explores three gray zones relevant to simulations over complex terrain: turbulence, convection, and topography. Taken together, these may be referred to as the gray continuum. The focus is on horizontal grid resolutions from ∼10 km to ∼10 m. In each case, the challenges are presented together with recent progress in the literature. A common theme is to address cross-scale interaction and scale-awareness in parameterization schemes. How numerical models are designed to cross these gray zones is critical to complex terrain applications in numerical weather prediction, wind resource forecasting, and regional climate modeling, among others.},

	abstract = {Diurnal mountain wind systems are local thermally driven wind systems that form over mountainous terrain and are produced by the buoyancy effects associated with the diurnal cycle of heating and cooling of the lower atmospheric layers. This chapter reviews the present scientific understanding of diurnal mountain wind systems, focusing on research findings published since 1988. Slope flows are examined first, as they provide a good introduction to the many factors affecting diurnal mountain wind systems. The energy budgets governing slope flows; the effects of turbulence, slope angle, ambient stability, background flows and slope inhomogeneities on slope flows; and the methods used to simulate slope flows are examined. Then, valley winds are reviewed in a similar manner and the diurnal phases of valley and slope winds and their interactions are summarized. Recent research on large-scale mountain-plain wind systems is reviewed, with an emphasis on the Rocky Mountains and the Alps. Winds occurring in closed basins and over plateaus are then discussed, and analogies between the two wind systems are outlined. This is followed by a discussion of forecasting considerations for diurnal mountain wind systems. Finally, the chapter concludes with a summary of open questions and productive areas for further research.},

	abstract = {The Persistent Cold-Air Pool Study (PCAPS) was conducted in Utah's Salt Lake valley from 1 December 2010 to 7 February 2011. The field campaign's primary goal was to improve understanding of the physical processes governing the evolution of multiday cold-air pools (CAPs) that are common in mountain basins during the winter. Meteorological instrumentation deployed throughout the Salt Lake valley provided observations of the processes contributing to the formation, maintenance, and destruction of 10 persistent CAP episodes. The close proximity of PCAPS field sites to residences and the University of Utah campus allowed many undergraduate and graduate students to participate in the study. Ongoing research, supported by the National Science Foundation, is using the PCAPS dataset to examine CAP evolution. Preliminary analyses reveal that variations in CAP thermodynamic structure are attributable to a multitude of physical processes affecting local static stability: for example, synoptic-scale processes impact changes in temperatures and cloudiness aloft while variations in boundary layer forcing modulate the lower levels of CAPs. During episodes of strong winds, complex interactions between the synoptic and mesoscale f lows, local thermodynamic structure, and terrain lead to both partial and complete removal of CAPs. In addition, the strength and duration of CAP events affect the local concentrations of pollutants such as PM2.5.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This study addresses the atmospheric boundary layer dynamics in the Grenoble valleys during persistent inversions, for 5 months during the 2006–2007 winter. During a persistent inversion, the boundary layer contains a layer with a positive vertical temperature gradient over a few days. Temperature data recorded on the valley sidewalls are first used. A bulk measure of the boundary layer stability, based upon the temperature difference between the valley top and the valley bottom, is introduced and a criterion is proposed to detect persistent inversions. We show that this criterion is equivalently expressed in terms of the heat deficit inside the boundary layer. Nine episodes are detected and coincide with the PM$_{\textrm{10}}$-polluted periods of the 2006–2007 winter. Secondly, the five strongest and longest persistent inversions are simulated using the MesoNH model. Focus is made on the stagnation stage of the episode, during which the inversion exhibits a diurnal cycle that does not significantly evolve from day to day. Whatever the episode, the inversion develops from the ground over a height of about 1200 m, with a nighttime temperature strength reaching 20 K. The boundary-layer dynamics within the inversion layer are fully decoupled from the (anticyclonic, weak) synoptic flow, independent from the synoptic-wind direction and similar whatever the episode. This implies that these dynamics are controlled by thermal winds and solely depends upon the geometry of the topography and upon the radiative cooling of the ground. Finally, a 2-day high-resolution simulation is made for the strongest case, representative of any persistent inversion. The flow pattern displays a well-defined spatial structure, with a vertical layering resulting from the superposition of the down-valley winds flowing from the different valleys surrounding Grenoble. This pattern persists all day long over a shallow convective layer of about 50 m forming above the ground during the reduced daytime period. Within this shallow layer, convection triggers a weak up-valley wind. Ventilation and stagnation areas in the surface layer are also computed, providing insights for air quality studies. The main characteristics of these persistent inversions are comparable to the most extreme wintertime inversions recorded in the Grand Canyon, Arizona.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Nighttime cold-air-pool events observed from October 2001 to June 2002 are categorized into undisturbed inversion evolution, late buildups, early breakups, mixing events, layered erosion at the inversion top, temperature disturbances occurring in the lower or upper elevations of the pool, and inversion buildup caused by the temporary clearing of clouds. In addition, persistent multiday cold-air pools are sometimes seen. Analyses show that strong winds and cloud cover are the governing meteorological parameters that cause the inversion behavior to deviate from its undisturbed state, but wind direction can also play an important role in the life cycle of the cold-air pools, because it governs the interaction with steep or gentle slopes of the underlying topography. Undisturbed cold-air pools are unusual in the Grünloch basin. A schematic diagram illustrates the different types of cold-air-pool events.},

	abstract = {Cold-air pools pose a significant challenge for numerical weather prediction models, primarily because they are often characterized by very stable stratification. Traditional surface-layer parameterizations, which rely on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, tend to be ineffective in these conditions. Additionally, the processes involved are highly localized and occur on small spatial scales, necessitating models with high horizontal and vertical resolutions. Within the TEAMx research programme, a model intercomparison study is being undertaken. The goal is to assess how well various numerical weather prediction models, each with a horizontal grid spacing of 1 km, can simulate a nocturnal cold-air pool within an Alpine valley. Five models are currently participating in the intercomparison study, including both operational and research models, specifically AROME, ICON, Meso-NH, the Unified Model, and WRF. For the intercomparison, a case study was selected from a multi-day undisturbed period during the PIANO (Penetration and Interruption of Alpine Foehn) field campaign conducted in the Inn Valley, Austria, in fall 2017.The presentation will show first results from the model intercomparison study. An extensive dataset is available for model evaluation from the PIANO measurement campaign, including vertical profiles of wind, temperature, and humidity from multiple Doppler wind lidars and a microwave temperature and humidity profiler, surface observations including surface-energy fluxes from multiple automatic weather stations and eddy-covariance stations, and spatially distributed temperature measurements from a dense network of temperature sensors. The model evaluation and intercomparison covers the entire lifecycle of the cold-air pool, from its initial formation in the afternoon to its dissipation the following day. The analysis addresses specifically the question of how well the simulations represent the cold-air pool's characteristics, such as its intensity, vertical structure, and spatial heterogeneity, and the processes contributing to the temporal evolution and spatial structure of the cold-air pool.},

	abstract = {The paper presents the results of high-resolution simulations performed with the WRF Model, coupled with two different land surface schemes, Noah and Noah\_MP, with the aim of accurately reproducing winter season meteorological conditions in a typical Alpine valley. Accordingly, model results are compared against data collected during an intensive field campaign performed in the Adige Valley, in the eastern Italian Alps. In particular, the ability of the model in reproducing the time evolution of 2-m temperature and of incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation is examined. The validation of model results highlights that, in this context, WRF reproduces rather poorly near-surface temperature over snow-covered terrain, with an evident underestimation, during both daytime and nighttime. Furthermore it fails to capture specific atmospheric processes, such as the temporal evolution of the ground-based thermal inversion. The main cause of these errors lies in the miscalculation of the mean gridcell albedo, resulting in an inaccurate estimate of the reflected solar radiation calculated by both Noah and Noah\_MP. Therefore, modifications to the initialization, to the land-use classification, and to both land surface models are performed to improve model results, by intervening in the calculation of the albedo, of the snow cover, and of the surface temperature. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that, after these changes, a significant improvement in the comparability between model results and observations is achieved. In particular, outgoing shortwave radiation is lowered, 2-m temperature maxima increased accordingly, and ground-based thermal inversions are better captured.},

	abstract = {Realistically representing the land–atmosphere interactions during persistent cold-air pools (PCAPs) is critical in simulating the strength of PCAPs, where uncertainties in simulating the PCAP strength will impact the ability to model the poor air quality. To quantify the model performance for land–atmosphere exchange, measurements of surface turbulent and radiative energy fluxes during two PCAPs, one weak and one strong, in Utah were compared with simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. The results show that the WRF Model simulated the surface energy fluxes well in the weak PCAP case and that the performance degraded in the strong PCAP case. The significantly overestimated surface sensible heat flux H and latent heat flux (LE) in the strong PCAP were related, in part, to the overestimated net radiation and soil moisture and unsuitable turbulence parameterizations. The simulation using the Mellor–Yamada–Nakanishi–Niino planetary boundary layer scheme produced the least bias in both net radiation and surface turbulent fluxes for the strong PCAP case, which is expected because of the local higher-order (2.5) turbulence closure scheme. The surface exchange coefficient (CH), a crucial variable used to calculate H, was overall overestimated by the WRF Model. The underestimation of the nondimensional vertical temperature gradient in the Monin–Obukhov stability function was responsible for the overestimated CH, where the stability functions deviate significantly from expected values from observations for the stable atmospheric boundary layer. Our study highlights the need to improve the flux–profile parameterizations under stable conditions over complex terrain by including impacts due to mountainous terrain, such as surface radiative flux divergence and the diurnal mountain wind system.},

A two-layer stable atmosphere forms in the basin, with a very strong inversion in the lowest part, below the approximate height of the lowest gap in the surrounding orography. The upper part of the stable layer is less strongly stratified and extends to the approximate height of the second-lowest gap. The basin atmosphere cools most strongly during the first few hours of the night, after which temperatures decrease only slowly. An outflow of air forms through the lowest gap in the surrounding orography. The outflow connects with a weak inflow of air through a gap on the opposite sidewall, forming a vertically and horizontally confined jet over the basin. Basin cooling shows strong sensitivity to surface-layer characteristics, highlighting the large impact of variations in vegetation and soil cover on cold-air pool development, as well as the importance of surface-layer parametrization in numerical simulations of cold-air-pool development.},

	abstract = {The formation of stably stratified nocturnal Cold Air Pools (CAPs) is a frequently observed phenomenon in mountain valleys and sinkholes. Accurate representation of CAPs in numerical weather prediction models is important because they de termine local temperatures, may deteriorate air quality, and promote high-impact weather such as freezing rain. The CAP episode from 15-16 October, 2017, in the Inn Valley (Austria) has been selected for an evaluation of simulations conducted with the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model 1 km horizontal grid resolution. As this case was part of the Penetration and Interruption of Alpine Foehn (PIANO) field campaign, high abundance of observational data allows for a thorough analy sis of the horizontal and vertical structure of the CAP, as well as of the processes driving the CAP life cycle. The observational data reveals that this CAP episode featured a near-surface air temperature decrease of 17 K during formation and ma ture phase. The vertical expansion of the CAP is limited by a topping inversion at about 1000 m above ground level. ICON exhibits a significant warm bias below the top of the inversion, but manages to simulate the timing of the CAP life cycle well. The emission of longwave radiation from the Earth’s surface towards the atmo sphere proved to be the main mechanism for the simulated cooling, while turbulent heating was responsible for the dissipation of the simulated CAP. The discrepancies between the simulations and observations are mainly related to the representation of radiation and turbulence in the model as well as to the insufficient representation of the complex topography due to a too coarse horizontal resolution of the model.},

It started with a foehn air intrusion to the northeast of Innsbruck and continued with the westward propagation of the foehn–CAP boundary along the valley. Subsequently observed northerly winds above the city were caused by an atmospheric rotor. A few hours later and prior to the cold front passage, the CAP pushed back and lifted the foehn air from the ground. During both nights, shear flow instabilities formed at the foehn–CAP interface, which resulted in turbulent heating of the CAP and cooling of the foehn. However, this turbulent heating/cooling was partly compensated by other mechanisms. Especially in the presence of strong spatial CAP heterogeneity during the second night, heating in the CAP was most likely overcompensated by negative horizontal temperature advection.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of four south föhn events observed during the Penetration and Interruption of Alpine Foehn (PIANO) field campaign in the Inn Valley, Austria, in the vicinity of Innsbruck. The goal is to detect and quantify processes of cold-air pool (CAP) erosion by föhn as well as processes of föhn breakdown. Despite differences in föhn breakthrough and strength, the four cases exhibit similarities in CAP evolution: initially, the CAP experienced strongest warming in the centre of Innsbruck, where the föhn jet from the Wipp Valley interacted with the CAP in the Inn Valley. The resulting shear-flow instability at the föhn–CAP interface caused turbulent CAP erosion and, together with vertical warm-air advection, led to CAP depression over the city centre. This depression drove pre-föhn westerlies near the surface that caused cold-air advection inside the CAP west of the city centre and warm-air advection in the east. Ultimately, the latter contributed to stronger CAP erosion in the east than in the west. This stronger heating also explains the preferential initial föhn breakthrough at the valley floor east of Innsbruck. In two of the cases, subsequent westward propagation of the föhn–CAP boundary across the city accompanied by northerly (deflected) föhn winds led to a complete föhn breakthrough. Föhn breakdown occurred either by a backflow of the CAP remnant or by a cold-frontal passage. This study emphasizes the importance of both turbulence and advection in the CAP heat budget and reveal their large spatio–temporal variability.},

Under most conditions the PM2.5 concentrations and atmospheric stability increased with time during these events, so that the highest PM2.5 concentrations were observed in long-lived CAPs. PM2.5 concentrations were generally observed to decrease with increasing elevation and were linearly related to the pre-sunrise valley heat deficit, an instantaneous measure of atmospheric stability. Decreases of up to 30 percent were observed as elevation increased from 1300 to 1600 m. During the CAP episode of 23–30 January, concentrations of PM2.5 increased roughly linearly with time at all elevations at the rate of about 6 μg (m3 day)−1. Higher elevation sites also experienced more rapid influxes of clean air during the mix-out of a CAP on 16 January, although short-lived episodes of higher concentrations occurred at times when polluted air was carried upslope from the residual CAP that persisted at lower elevations.},

In this paper, the authors review these issues and provide an overview of the current understanding and model performance. Results from weather forecast and climate models are used to illustrate the state of the art as well as findings and recommendations from three intercomparison studies held within the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) Atmospheric Boundary Layer Study (GABLS). Within GABLS, the focus has been on the examination of the representation of the stable boundary layer and the diurnal cycle over land in clear-sky conditions. For this purpose, single-column versions of weather and climate models have been compared with observations, research models, and large-eddy simulations. The intercomparison cases are based on observations taken in the Arctic, Kansas, and Cabauw in the Netherlands.

          This study introduces a novel evaluation technique for mesoscale atmospheric models in complex terrain, addressing challenges related to grid point (GP) selection, model resolution, and differences in the terrain and measurement heights between model and observation sites. The technique includes a pre-evaluation step designed to enhance model evaluation accuracy by correcting for systematic biases arising from discrepancies in sensor height between surface-layer diagnosed variables and actual measurement heights. Additionally, a lapse rate correction is proposed that takes into account the temporal evolution of the valley atmosphere. We use a GP for the evaluation with point measurements that represents the topographic characteristics at the measurement site better than the nearest GP. 
The analysis of a case study using a WRF simulation with different grid spacing is conducted for a synoptically undisturbed valley wind day over the Inn Valley, to study the effect of grid resolution during an entire diurnal cycle.
The proposed method shows significant potential in reducing uncertainties in model performance assessments by selecting GPs that better represent in-situ conditions, including accurate land cover and orography characteristics. This approach is expected to facilitate more reliable inter-model comparisons and enhance the overall robustness of atmospheric model evaluations in complex terrains.},

	abstract = {Persistent midwinter cold air pools produce multiday periods of cold, dreary weather in basins and valleys. Persistent stable stratification leads to the buildup of pollutants and moisture in the pool. Because the pool sometimes has temperatures below freezing while the air above is warmer, freezing precipitation often occurs, with consequent effects on transportation and safety. Forecasting the buildup and breakdown of these cold pools is difficult because the interacting physical mechanisms leading to their formation, maintenance, and destruction have received little study. In this paper, persistent wintertime cold pools in the Columbia River basin of eastern Washington are studied. First a succinct meteorological definition of a cold pool is provided and then a 10-yr database is used to develop a cold pool climatology. This is followed by a detailed examination of two cold pool episodes that were accompanied by fog and stratus using remote and in situ temperature and wind sounding data. The two episodes illustrate many of the physical mechanisms that affect cold pool evolution. In one case, the cold pool was formed by warm air advection above the basin and was destroyed by downslope winds that descended into the southern edge of the basin and progressively displaced the cold air in the basin. In the second case, the cold pool began with a basin temperature inversion on a clear night and strengthened when warm air was advected above the basin by a westerly flow that descended from the Cascade Mountains. The cold pool was nearly destroyed one afternoon by cold air advection aloft and by the growth of a convective boundary layer (CBL) following the partial breakup of the basin stratus. The cold pool restrengthened, however, with nighttime cooling and was destroyed the next afternoon by a growing CBL.},

The buildup takes place over one or more days as warm air advection occurs above the basin with the approach of high pressure ridges. The breakup, which occurs with cold air advection above the basin as troughs approach, can occur over periods less than 12 h. Many approaching troughs modulate inversion strength and depth but are too weak to destroy the persistent inversion.

	abstract = {Meteorological mechanisms affecting the evolution of a persistent wintertime cold air pool that began on 2 January and ended on 7 January 1999 in the Columbia basin of eastern Washington were investigated using a mesoscale numerical model together with limited observations. The mechanisms include surface radiative cooling and heating, large-scale subsidence, temperature advection, downslope warming in the lee of a major mountain barrier, and low-level cloudiness. The cold pool began when cold air accumulated over the basin floor on a clear night and was maintained by a strong capping inversion resulting from a rapid increase of air temperatures above the cold pool. This increase of temperatures aloft was produced primarily by downslope warming associated with strong westerly winds descending the lee slopes of the north–south-oriented Cascade Mountains that form the western boundary of the Columbia basin. While the inversion cap at the top of the cold pool descended with time as the westerly flow intensified, the air temperature inside the cold pool exhibited little variation because of the fog and stratus accompanying the cold pool. Although the low-level clouds reduced the diurnal temperature oscillations inside the pool, their existence was not critical to maintaining the cold pool because surface radiative heating on a midwinter day was insufficient to completely destroy the temperature deficit in the persistent inversion. The presence of low-level clouds becomes much more critical for the maintenance of persistent cold pools in the spring and, perhaps, the fall seasons when insolation is much stronger than in midwinter. The cold pool was destroyed by cold air advection aloft, which weakened and eventually removed the strong inversion cap, and by an unstable boundary layer that grew upward from the heated ground after the dissipation of low-level clouds. Finally, erosion of the cold pool from above by turbulent mixing produced by vertical wind shear at the interface between quiescent air within the pool and stronger winds aloft was found to be insignificant for this case.},

	abstract = {The present study investigates persistent inversions dynamics during a whole winter in Alpine valleys of the area of Grenoble (French Alps), and their relationship to PM10 air pollution episodes and synoptic scale meteorology. For this purpose, hourly time series from November to March of PM10 concentration measurements at the bottom of the valleys and of ground-based temperature data at different altitudes are used. A methodology is developed to quantify a simple estimate of the inversion strength from temperature profiles deduced from the ground-based observations. This estimate is shown to be equivalent to the boundary layer heat deficit. A criterion based on this estimate is proposed to identify persistent (more than 3 days) inversions. Persistent inversions are found to occur from November to February and span 35\% of the time. It is shown that they are closely related to PM10 pollution episodes, the PM10 concentration increasing with the boundary layer stability as the inversion develops. Polluted episodes are primarily driven by persistent inversions and consequently, pollution is of fully local origin from November to February. In March local dynamics become less important and long-range transport can dominate. Persistent inversions occur systematically during a high-pressure regime, which first triggers a synoptic scale elevated inversion due to the advection of warm air masses in the mid-troposphere. In valleys, the sheltered boundary layer becomes decoupled from the free troposphere, which allows a ground-based inversion to intensify in the following days. An inversion layer of quasi-constant temperature gradient, greater than 5 K km−1, then forms up to an altitude of about 1600 m, close to the average elevation of the summits. If the episode is sufficiently long, a stagnation stage is reached during which daytime insolation produces a shallow convective surface layer which does not destroy the persistent inversion. The inversion break-up occurs rapidly, in less than a day, because of synoptic scale advection of cold air masses in the mid-troposphere when a low-pressure regime approaches. The end-of-episode decrease in PM10 concentration is due to precipitation combined with an increased ventilation inside the boundary-layer.},

The temperature structure of the cold pools is examined using transects of ground-based sensors through the valleys and radiosonde releases from within the valley, in order to evaluate simple two-dimensional concepts of cold-pool formation due to sheltering. The cold-pool spatial and temporal structure is found to be consistent between different nights when strong cold pools occurred. Initially a sharp surface inversion occurs similarly at all points within the valley, with isentropes roughly terrain-parallel. The inversion layer at the bottom of the valley then grows deeper, spreading over the bottom portion of the valley, and cross-valley isentropes eventually become horizontal. By defining appropriate measures of the relative temperature drop within the cold pool, and non-dimensional valley depth diagnosed with respect to the speed and stability of the approaching flow, the measurements are shown to be consistent with previous relationships determined for simple two-dimensional valleys.},

	abstract = {Tethered balloon soundings from two sites on the floor of a 1-km-diameter limestone sinkhole in the eastern Alps are compared with pseudovertical temperature “soundings” from three lines of temperature dataloggers on the basin's northwest, southwest, and southeast sidewalls. Under stable nighttime conditions with low background winds, the pseudovertical profiles from all three lines were good proxies for free air temperature soundings over the basin center, with a mean nighttime cold temperature bias of about 0.4°C and a standard deviation of 0.4°C. Cold biases were highest in the upper basin where relatively warm air subsides to replace air that spills out of the basin through the lowest-altitude saddle. On a windy night, standard deviations increased to 1°–2°C. After sunrise, the varying exposures of the dataloggers to sunlight made the pseudovertical profiles less useful as proxies for free air soundings. The good correspondence between sidewall and free air temperatures during high-static-stability conditions suggests that sidewall soundings can be used to monitor temperatures, temperature gradients, and temperature inversion evolution in the sinkhole. Sidewall soundings can produce more frequent profiles at lower cost than can tethersondes or rawinsondes, and extension of these findings to other enclosed or semienclosed topographies may enhance future basic meteorological research or support applications studies in agriculture, forestry, air pollution, and land use planning.},

	abstract = {Elucidating cold-air-pooling processes forms part of the longstanding problem of parametrizing the effects of complex terrain in larger-scale numerical models. The Weather Research and Forecasting model has been set-up and run at high resolution over an idealized alpine-valley domain with a width of order 10 km, to investigate the four-dimensional variation of key cold-air-pooling forcing mechanisms, under decoupled stable conditions. Results of the simulation indicated that the total average valley-atmosphere cooling is driven by a complex balance/interplay between radiation and dynamical effects. Three fairly distinct regimes in the evolution of cold-air-pooling processes have been identified. Starting about 1 h before sunset, there is an initial 30-min period when the downslope flows are initiated and the total average valley-atmosphere instantaneous cooling is dominated by radiative heat loss. A period of instability follows, when there is a competition between radiation and dynamical effects, lasting some 90 min. Finally, there is a gradual reduction of the contribution of radiative cooling from 75 to 37 \%. The maximum cold-air-pool intensity corresponds to the time of minimum radiative cooling, within the period of instability. Although, once the flow is established, the valley atmosphere cools at broadly similar rates by radiation and dynamical effects, overall, radiation effects dominate the total average valley-atmosphere cooling. Some of the intricacies of the valley mixing have been revealed. There are places where the dynamics dominate the cooling and radiation effects are minor. Characteristics of internal gravity waves propagating away from the slopes are discussed.},

	abstract = {A numerical model simulation of the formation of a cold pool within a narrow valley during a clear calm night is presented. The results are compared with measurements made during the COLd air Pooling EXperiment (COLPEX). It is demonstrated that the model provides a realistic simulation of the observed cold pool. The cold pool begins to form approximately 1.5 hours before sunset, when the near-surface air within the valley starts to cool more rapidly than the air on the surrounding hills. The model potential temperature budget is used to determine which physical processes are most important for the evolution of the cold pool. The results show that sheltering provided by the valley causes a turbulent heat ﬂux divergence over the lowest 5 m above the valley ﬂoor, which is large compared with the other terms in the budget. This causes relatively rapid cooling of the air adjacent to the ground. On the surrounding hills the turbulent heat ﬂux divergence is larger than in the valley, but the enhanced cooling this provides is approximately balanced by an almost equally large warming tendency from advection. The net eﬀect of these two terms is small compared with that in the valley and therefore the cooling rate is smaller. Above 5 m, the cooling in the valley is dominated by local transport of cold air away from the surface into the interior valley atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Urbanized valleys are particularly vulnerable to particulate air pollution during the winter, when ground-based stable layers or cold-air pools persist over the valley floor. We examine whether the temporal variability of PM10 concentration in the section of the Arve River Valley between Cluses and Servoz in the French Alps can be explained by the temporal variability of the valley heat deficit, a bulk measure of atmospheric stability within the valley. We do this on the basis of temperature profile and ground-based PM10 concentration data collected during wintertime with a temporal resolution of 1 h or finer, as part of the Passy-2015 field campaign conducted around Passy in this section of valley. The valley heat deficit was highly correlated with PM10 concentration on a daily time scale. The hourly variability of PM10 concentrations was more complex and cannot be explained solely by the hourly variability of the valley heat deficit. The interplay of the diurnal cycles of emissions and local dynamics is demonstrated and a drainage mechanism for observed nocturnal dilution of near-surface PM10 concentrations is proposed.},
