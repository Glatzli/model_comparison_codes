# Auto-generated requirements for this repository (generated 2025-11-22)
# Listed only packages that appear imported in the project files.
# Some packages (cartopy, rasterio, geopandas) require system libraries; see their docs.

# install packages via: pip install -r requirements.txt (use an environment!)
# on Windows it's easier to use conda for the packages cartopy, rasterio, geopandas, gdal:
# conda create -n envname python=3.11
# conda activate envname
# conda install -c conda-forge cartopy rasterio geopandas gdal
# pip install -r requirements.txt   # installiert restliche Pakete

# Notes:
# - These are recommended minimum versions, not strict pins. If you need an exact
#   environment for reproducible runs, create a pinned lockfile (pip-tools/pipenv/poetry).

# - For scanned PDFs you will need OCR (tesseract + pdf2image + pytesseract) which
#   are NOT included here.
# - Install on Windows often requires Visual C++ build tools and GDAL/proj binaries
#   for packages such as rasterio and geopandas. See package docs for platform notes.
